1/2 cup smoked olive oil
 Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
1 -1/2 pounds baby creamer potatoes in assorted colors

COULD NOT PARSE

DIRECTIONS
Roast the chicken. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone and discard it. Flatten the chicken and cut it in half through the breast so you have two halves-each with a leg and breast. Rub all over with some of the smoked olive oil, ensuring it gets in all the crevices. Season all over with salt and pepper.
Set the chicken in a large roasting pan over two burners and heat over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the chicken halves skin-side down and sear for 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over, add the potatoes to the pan, and drizzle with more smoked olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the joint between the thigh and drumstick reads 160 degrees to 165 degrees F. The potatoes should be golden on the outside and tender in the middle. Remove from the oven and allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes.
Make the citrus salsa. Use a sharp knife to cut away the rind and pith from each of the citrus fruits. Holding the fruit over a bowl, carefully cut between the membranes to free the segments. Let the juices and segments fall into the bowl. Add about  cup extra-virgin olive oil to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cut the radishes into very fine matchsticks on a mandoline or with a sharp knife. Fold them into the citrus salsa, and add the chives.
Serve the roasted chicken with the potatoes and citrus salsa, and garnish with flowering cilantro. Season with fleur de sel.

Perfect Citrus Turkey and Gravy

INGREDIENTS
1 (12-pound) turkey, with giblets (see cooking notes at bottom of recipe)
1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened, plus 1 tablespoon
2 lemons, zested
1/2 cup chopped chives
2 tablespoons coarse salt
 Freshly ground black pepper
1 small orange, halved
1 small grapefruit, halved

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons cornstarch

LEVEL

DIRECTIONS
Take the turkey out of the refrigerator and leave it to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes prior to preparing and cooking. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
In a mixing bowl, add the 1/2 cup softened butter, lemon zest and chopped chives. Halve the lemons and squeeze the juice of 1 lemon half into the butter. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
Prepare the turkey: Remove the inner packet of giblets from the cavity and set aside.
Run your fingers underneath the skin of the breast to make a little pocket between the skin and the flesh. Using your fingers, scoop up some of the lemon-chive butter and push the butter under the skin, filling up the pockets. Do the same thing on the legs. Once each pocket has been filled, take the rest of the butter and rub it all over the outside of the bird. Sprinkle about a tablespoon and a half of coarse salt on top.
Insert the halved lemons, orange and grapefruit into the cavity of the turkey. Insert as much of the citrus as you can. Give each piece a little squeeze as you insert them to get the juices distributed. (You may have to leave some out depending on the size of the cavity. Use any extra citrus for garnish later.)
Remove the giblets from the packet, rinse and pat dry. Place the giblets on the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the turkey on top of the giblets. Tuck the wings under the turkey.
Place the turkey in a preheated oven and cook for 30 minutes. Then, turn down the heat to 350 degrees F and roast for about another 2 hours, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 175 to 180 degrees F. (The general rule is to cook a turkey about 15 minutes per pound.)
Remove the bird from the pan onto a carving board or platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving.
Place the roasting pan over low heat on the stovetop. Add white wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour in the chicken stock. Whisk the cornstarch into it. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and the Dijon mustard. Whisk well to combine. Strain the gravy into a small saucepan and simmer over low heat until thick and smooth, about 8 minutes.
Bring your turkey to room temperature to ensure that the bird will cook evenly.
Stuffing a turkey with fruit keep the bird moist and acts as a secondary cooking agent. As the juice of the fruit steams inside the cavity, it helps cook the bird from the inside. The juices also help to flavor the pan juices used for making the gravy.
Stuffing butter between the skin and the flesh, keep the meat moist and flavorful. The butter and salt on the outside help create a tasty, crispy skin.
I like to use the giblets as a platform for the bird. It stops the bottom of the bird from burning and adds flavor to the pan juices.
A good rule for roasting times is to plan on roasting a turkey for about 15 minutes per pound.
A meat thermometer is the best tool for figuring out if your turkey is fully cooked.

LEVEL

DIRECTIONS
Position an oven rack in the top position in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Toss the onions, celery, carrots and garlic with the oil and 1 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the vegetables are charred in some places, 25 to 30 minutes.
Bring the roasted vegetables, 1 cup water, mushrooms, thyme, sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is gone, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bring back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer until reduced by about one third, about 45 minutes. Strain the stock through a strainer into a large liquid measuring cup, use the back of a ladle to squeeze all the liquid out of the solids (there should be about 4 cups of stock). If not making gravy right away, let the stock cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month.
To make the gravy, warm the stock slightly in a medium saucepan if it has been refrigerated. Melt the butter in another medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves, and stir for 30 seconds; remove and set aside. Add the flour to the saucepan, and stir until smooth and lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in the warm stock while whisking constantly until smooth and thick, 8 to 10 minutes.
Chop up the fried sage, stir it into the gravy along with the parsley and season to taste with pepper.

DIRECTIONS
Cook the bacon in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until extra crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined-plate to drain and reserve the fat in the skillet.
Meanwhile pack a 1 cup dry measure tightly with a 1/2 cup of the Old Fashioned Turkey Stuffing. Dump the stuffing onto a baking sheet and press down into a 4-inch-wide-cake, using a flat spatula. Repeat until you have 4 patties.
Heat the reserved bacon fat in the skillet over medium heat. Carefully lay 2 patties in the skillet and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes each side. Transfer the patties to a plate and repeat with the remaining 2 patties.
Add oil to the skillet if needed. Add the sage and fry, about 30 seconds. Transfer the sage to a paper-towel-lined-plate using a slotted spoon.
Divide the turkey meat onto each patty and pour gravy over top. Crumble 1 crispy bacon slice over the turkey. Dollop with the Simple Cranberry Sauce and garnish with the sage.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 14-by-9-inch baking dishes. Arrange the bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.
Heat some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter, celery and onions and cook until the vegetables are lightly browned and translucent. Set aside to cool.
Add the bread cubes, celery mixture, broth, seasoning and eggs in a large bowl. Mix well until moist and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Divide between the 2 prepared baking dishes. Bake until the top of the stuffing is slightly crispy, about 40 minutes.

For the mayonnaise: In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and sweet pickles until smooth.
For the sandwiches: Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Season the tuna with salt and pepper. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the herbs de Provence. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Place a slice of cheese on each piece of fish during the last minute of grilling. Using a pastry brush, brush the bottom half of the bread with 1/4 cup of olive oil. Cut into 4 pieces, each about 4-inches long and 3-inches wide. Grill, cut side down, for 30 seconds to 1 minute until toasted and golden.
Spread the grilled bread with the sweet pickle mayonnaise. Place a tuna steak on top. Top with the arugula and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve.
Cook's Note: Make the leftover top half of the ciabatta into croutons by cutting into 1-inch pieces, drizzling with olive oil and baking for 10 to 12 minutes in a preheated 375 degree F oven. Alternatively, tear the bread into small pieces, allow to dry, and blend in a food processor to make bread crumbs.

DIRECTIONS
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Core and halve the tomatoes (leave the cherry tomatoes whole). Heat a flameproof roasting pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle with the 1/2 cup olive oil, then spread all of the tomatoes, the garlic and onions in the pan. Cook, stirring gently, until the garlic is browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the tomatoes are caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes.
Remove the roasted tomatoes, garlic and onions from the oven and transfer to a large stockpot (set aside the cherry tomatoes for garnish). Add 3 cups chicken stock, the bay leaves and butter. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is reduced by one-third, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaves.
Add the basil to the pot. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth (or puree in a regular blender and return to the pot). Reduce the heat to low, add the heavy cream and adjust the consistency with the remaining 1 cup chicken stock, if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with the roasted cherry tomatoes; drizzle with olive oil.
Serve with Grilled Cheese with Apple and Bacon.
When blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open; Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth.

DIRECTIONS
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (or the highest setting).
Bring the steaks to room temperature.
Meanwhile, remove 1 garlic clove from the bulb and finely grate. Remove the other cloves with the skin still intact and spread them on a baking sheet along with the tomatoes. Toss with about 1/4 cup EVOO and season with salt and pepper. Turn the tomatoes cut-side down. Roast until the tomatoes are charred and softened, 20 to 25 minutes.
Lightly toast the pine nuts in a small skillet over medium heat, then remove to a plate to cool.
Combine the parsley, basil, endive, radicchio, thyme, pine nuts, lemon juice and cheese in a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Pulse until chopped. With the motor running, drizzle in the remaining 1/2 cup EVOO in a slow stream until blended. Transfer the pesto to a serving dish. (Any leftover pesto is delicious on sandwiches or tossed with hot pasta and starchy cooking water.)
Heat a grill pan or heavy griddle over medium-high heat or prepare an outdoor grill.
Drizzle the steaks with EVOO and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and cook 3 more minutes for medium-rare. Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Place the steaks on serving plates and drizzle with the pesto. Serve the roasted tomatoes, garlic and bread on the side. To eat, squeeze the garlic from the skins and rub onto the bread, then top with the tomatoes.

DIRECTIONS
For the marinade: The day before you plan on cooking your steak, place the rib-eye in a resealable baggie along with the olive oil, rosemary, thyme and garlic. Move the herbs and garlic around in the bag to coat the steak with all the flavors. Refrigerate overnight.
For the steak: Remove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak evenly with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Place the steak on the grill pan and sear for 5 minutes without moving the steak. Flip the steak and repeat on the other side. Remove the steak to a baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 minutes for medium doneness. Allow the steak to rest for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix together the lemon zest, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons olive oil, rosemary, thyme, 1/8 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper. Set aside.
Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon olive oil and slide in the egg, being careful not to break the yolk. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently cook the egg until the white is just set and the yolk is still soft, about 3 minutes.
Transfer the rested steak to a serving plate. Scatter the arugula over the steak and drizzle 1 teaspoon of the herb oil. Lay the egg, sunny-side up, over the top. Drizzle with the remaining herb oil and season with a few grinds of black pepper.

DIRECTIONS
Thirty minutes before grilling the steaks, remove them from the refrigerator and allow them to come to room temperature. Heat a grill with coals.
When the coals are hot, spread them out in the grill in one solid layer. Pat the steaks dry on both sides with paper towels and sprinkle them liberally with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the hot grill and sear them on each side for 2 minutes, until browned. Brush each side lightly with olive oil. Place the lid on the grill and allow the steaks to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until they are cooked rare, or 120 degrees F on a meat thermometer. (To test the steaks, insert the thermometer sideways to be sure you're actually testing the middle of the steak.) Remove the steaks from the grill, place them in one layer on a platter and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Allow the steaks to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
For the stilton sauce, place the stilton cheese in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and blend until finely minced. Add the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, scallions, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Process until smooth.
Slice the steak and serve with the stilton sauce.

DIRECTIONS
Lay the steak flat on a board; tie kitchen twine tightly around the sides (including the bone) to help the steak keep its shape during cooking.
Grind the mushrooms in a spice grinder or blender; transfer to a bowl and mix with the garlic, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons rosemary, the red pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Cut 8 deep slits about 1 inch apart all over the steak; fill each slit with some of the mushroom mixture, then rub the rest all over the meat. Transfer the steak to a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator about 1 hour before grilling.
Meanwhile, combine the butter, scallions, parsley, the remaining 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tablespoon rosemary, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat a grill to medium high, then prepare for indirect heat: For gas, turn off the burners on one side. For charcoal, push the coals to one side. Brush the steak with the olive oil, then place on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Cover and cook, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 110 degrees F to 120 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. Move the steak to the hotter side of the grill (direct heat) and cook until the thermometer registers 125 degrees F, 2 to 3 more minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes, spreading with some of the herb butter.
Meanwhile, grill the peppers over direct heat, turning, brushing with the lemon juice and seasoning with salt, until charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Top the steak with more herb butter and serve with the peppers.

DIRECTIONS
Let the steaks sit out for 30 minutes before cooking to come to room temperature. Heat the canola oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Place them in the hot pan. Cook for about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove the steaks from the pan, cover them loosely with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing while you make the sauce.
Turn the temperature on the skillet down to medium. Add the shallots and cook until they soften a bit, about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring it up to a simmer. While the broth comes to a simmer, add the gravy mix to a small bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons water. Add to the broth, stir, and let simmer until thickened. Stir in the chocolate and cold butter to thicken the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.
Place the steaks onto a serving platter, pour the sauce over top (or serve on the side), and garnish with parsley. Serve with Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions.
In a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the mushrooms and onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook until they begin to soften and the mushrooms release their juices, about 7 minutes. Take the pan off of the heat and add the whiskey. Place back on the heat, add the thyme, and cook until the moisture has evaporated and the pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until the cream thickens a bit, 4 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

DIRECTIONS
For the steaks: In a small bowl, combine the paprika, thyme, salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Sprinkle on both sides of the steaks and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours.
In a large pan with straight sides, add the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and sear on both sides until a deep golden color is on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook about 4 minutes more. Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.
For the gravy: Using kitchen twine, tie the thyme and rosemary together. In the same pan you seared the steaks in, add the herb bundle and the butter. Lower the heat to medium, melt the butter and then add the onions. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of black pepper. Cook on medium heat until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes, and then add the garlic. When the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes, add the stone-ground mustard and beef stock. Stir to blend and then add the heavy cream. Taste and season with more salt, if needed, and raise the heat to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce has thickened to a gravy, lower the heat and stir in the sour cream. Add the reserved steaks back into the pan and bring to a simmer while spooning the sauce over the steaks. Cook this way until desired doneness; it should take only a minute more for medium-rare. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Place the slices on a serving plate and pour the gravy over the top.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Place the grapes on a sheet pan and coat with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Roast until the grapes turn light brown and begin to shrivel, about 45 minutes.
In the meantime, sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper and let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Heat a pot of water over high heat. Once the water is boiling, add the potatoes, parsnips, bay leaf, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 clove garlic and salt generously. Cook until the vegetables are fork tender, and then strain. Discard the herbs and press the potatoes, parsnips and garlic through a ricer into a saucepan. Gently stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Hold warm over low heat.
For the steaks, heat a skillet until very hot, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and place the steaks in the skillet. Cook about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove the steaks from the skillet to a plate and tent with foil. Add the red wine to the skillet to deglaze and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom. Add the chicken stock, remaining 1 clove garlic, carrots, onions, celery, the remaining 3 sprigs thyme, the remaining 1 bay leaf and the beef bone. Cook on high heat until the sauce reduces to a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes. Strain the sauce and add the roasted grapes. Slice the steak off the bone and add the steak juices to the sauce.
To serve, place a spoonful of the parsnips and potatoes on a plate, top with a few pieces of the steak and drizzle with the sauce.

DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven on broiler setting. Make foil 'snake' out of aluminum foil to use to keep oven door slightly ajar so that broiler won't turn off if it gets too hot. Brush steak with oil and salt and pepper, to taste. Place a piece of foil on the bottom rack as a drip pan. Place another rack in the position above this and put the steak directly on this rack. Cook steak in this position for 5 minutes. Flip steak and cook for another 5 minutes. Move rack with steak to top position in oven, moving rack with foil and drippings just underneath, and cook for 3 minutes. Flip 1 last time and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer steak to wire rack and rest for 3 to 5 minutes. The above times are for medium doneness. Adjust cooking times up or down as desired.

Easy Grilled Pork Chops

INGREDIENTS

DIRECTIONS
Begin by making the marinade. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, oil, vinegar, cumin and red pepper flakes. Easy, right?
Sprinkle both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper and place in a re-sealable plastic bag with the marinade. Let rest on the counter for 1 hour. That's easy.
Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Remove the pork chops from the bag and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until the pork chop releases from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another 3 minutes. If using a grill pan, be sure to do in batches so you don't steam the chops. And don't worry if you have neither; you can do this in a pan. See, easy!

DIRECTIONS
There are rubs and there are brines. A brine is a slower process where the rub, sugar and salt are diluted to penetrate the protein and break it down so that the meat is juicy, flavorful and tender after cooked. I love brined pork and chicken, but if I am cooking late and didn't think about it the day before, I will have to do a nice rub on the meat, which is just more concentrated and expedited, and that's what I have here. Pork chops go with so many accompaniments but I do love the acidity of apples or an applesauce with pork chops and the bite of mustard greens. You can use mizuna, or arugula if you cannot find mustard greens. Also, you can put a schmear of hot mustard mixed with a little honey or molasses on the plate instead for the kick. I like onion rings, in general. My other favorite accompaniment to pork chops is kimchee tossed with some fresh fruit such as peaches or plums.
To cook the pork chops: Grind all the spices together with the sugar and rub all over the pork chops. Set aside for 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature.
Preheat the grill on high or heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat on the stovetop and preheat the oven to 375 degrees (Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan if cooking in cast iron).
Cook the pork on one side for 4 to 5 minutes on the grill or in cast iron. Flip over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the grill; if cooking in cast iron, flip the chop and transfer to the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
To cook the sauteed apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon water and a drop of lemon juice. Cook until sugar caramelizes to golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the apple slices and star anise. Return the pan to medium-high heat, stir in the butter and remaining lemon juice. Saute, stirring, for 2 minutes, adding the brandy in the last minute of cooking with a pinch of salt. Simmer briefly to burn off the alcohol and thicken the caramel. Set aside.
To cook the onion rings: Bring the canola oil to 360 degrees F in a large pot. Combine the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish or bowl. Dip the onion rings in the flour mixture to dredge, shaking off any excess. Dip in the buttermilk to coat, and then back into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Working in batches, fry the rings until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
Serve the pork chops with the sauteed apples, onion rings and mustard greens.

DIRECTIONS
Build a multi-level fire in the grill: Leave 1/4 of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining 3/4 of the grill so that they are 3 times as high on 1 side as on the other. When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook.
Make spice rub: Combine the ingredients for the spice rub in a small bowl and mix well. Rub the pork chops generously on both sides with the mixture and set aside while making the sauce.
Make the sauce: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot, but not smoking. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 11 to 13 minutes. Add the peaches, ginger, and tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently for 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, orange juice, sugar, allspice, and salt and pepper, to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced by about 1/2 and thickened slightly, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust for the seasoning, then transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth (be careful with hot liquids). Reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting the chops, then pour the remaining sauce into a small serving bowl.
Put the chops on the grill over the coals and cook, turning once, until desired doneness; 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium. During the last 30 seconds of cooking on each side, baste the chops generously with the sauce. Check for doneness.
Serve the chops hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side.
Cook's note: The spice rub and barbecue sauce contains sugar, which might burn while cooking on the grill. If the chops start to burn on the outside, move them to cooler part of the grill and cover with a metal pie pan or disposable foil to finish cooking.

DIRECTIONS
Special equipment: a medium cast-iron skillet and four 5-inch cast-iron skillets
For the poblano relish: Heat the oil in a medium skillet until it shimmers. Add the onion and cook for 1 minute (just to take rawness off but still keep it crisp). Smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with salt, and mash to a puree using the side of your knife blade. Add it to the onion along with the chiles. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, to just heat through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the lime juice and cilantro.
For the Denver omelet frittatas and crispy hammy croutons: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place four 5-inch cast-iron skillets on a baking sheet and heat in the oven.
Add the oil to a medium cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the ham, sprinkle with pepper and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels.
Add the bread to the rendered fat and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to another plate lined with paper towels.
Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until very light and fluffy. Stir in the Monterey Jack, Cheddar and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the cooked ham and a few tablespoons of the poblano relish.
Carefully remove the baking sheet with the hot skillets from the oven and brush each with some softened butter. Quickly divide the egg mixture among the skillets, filling almost to the top, and immediately return to the oven. Cook until the eggs are puffy, lightly golden brown and just cooked through, about 15 minutes. Top each frittata with more poblano relish and some hammy croutons. Garnish with cilantro.

DIRECTIONS
Boil red potatoes to 90 percent cooked and cool in the refrigerator until cold. When potatoes are cold, cut into medium sized chunks and saute in 1 tablespoon of margarine and 1 tablespoon of butter. When the potatoes are almost finished sauteing, begin to cook the bacon crisply and cut into small pieces. Set aside. Just before the potatoes are browned, sprinkle garlic, onions, salt and pepper onto the potatoes. Drain off excess oil. Set aside. Saute mushrooms. Set aside. Whip 3 eggs together. Grease a 10-inch omelet pan with margarine over a medium heat. Have all other ingredients ready to assemble quickly after the eggs are cooked. Put the eggs in a pan and cook slowly over a medium heat. With a spatula, push the eggs to the center of the pan. Remember that this is an open omelet so do not fold over. As the eggs begin to seal on the bottom, keep folding the loose eggs under the cooked portion. When almost all the loose egg is cooked, clip the eggs over. Lay the cooked eggs flat on a plate. Spread sour cream, and then place potatoes on the eggs, followed with mushrooms, tomatoes and bacon. Top with feta cheese.
